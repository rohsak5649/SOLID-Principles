# üåü SOLID Principles in C++ (Beginner-Friendly) üöÄ

Welcome to the easiest and cleanest explanation of the **SOLID principles** using **C++**!  
These 5 principles help you write clean, maintainable, and bug-free code using object-oriented design.

## üìö What is SOLID?

> **SOLID** is an acronym for 5 design principles in OOP:

| Letter | Principle                         | One-Liner Explanation                          |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| S      | Single Responsibility Principle   | One class = One job                            |
| O      | Open/Closed Principle             | Extend without changing existing code          |
| L      | Liskov Substitution Principle     | Subclasses can stand in for base classes       |
| I      | Interface Segregation Principle   | No forced unnecessary functions in interfaces  |
| D      | Dependency Inversion Principle    | High-level code depends on interfaces, not details |

## üîπ 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> **"A class should have only one reason to change."**

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:
üìÑ A person who handles both **cooking and driving** will mess up one of them.  
‚úÖ Hire a **Chef** to cook, and a **Driver** to drive.

### ‚ùå BAD Example:
A class `Report` does both data and file writing.

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example:
Split into `ReportData` and `ReportPrinter` classes.

---

## üîπ 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> **"Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:
üéÆ You can add **new games to your console**, without **changing** the console.

### ‚ùå BAD Example:
If you add a new shape, you must change the drawing logic.

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example:
Use a base class `Shape` with `draw()` function. Extend it by adding new shape classes like `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Triangle`.

---

## üîπ 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> **"Subclasses should be replaceable for their base class without breaking the app."**

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:
üêï A **Dog** is a kind of **Animal**, and it can walk.  
ü¶Ü A **Duck** is also an **Animal**, but if a **ToyDuck** can't fly ‚Äî don‚Äôt use it as an Animal unless it behaves like one.

### ‚ùå BAD Example:
Derived classes that override functions in wrong way (e.g., throwing errors in base class functions).

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example:
Make sure derived classes support all behavior expected from base classes.

---

## üîπ 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> **"Don‚Äôt force a class to implement methods it doesn‚Äôt need."**

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:
üñ• A **Printer** shouldn‚Äôt be forced to support **scan** and **fax** if it can only **print**.  
‚úÖ Make small interfaces like `IPrinter`, `IScanner`, `IFax`.

### ‚ùå BAD Example:
One big interface with `print()`, `scan()`, `fax()` ‚Äî even if some classes only need one.

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example:
Create small, specific interfaces for each task.

---

## üîπ 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**

### üß† Real-Life Analogy:
üîå You use a **universal switch** to turn on devices like Bulb, Fan, or AC ‚Äî  
‚úÖ The switch should depend on an interface like `Device`, not on a specific class like `Bulb`.

### ‚ùå BAD Example:
Switch is tightly coupled with `Bulb`.

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example:
Switch uses `IDevice` interface and can work with `Bulb`, `Fan`, or any future device.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Principle | Key Focus                         | Real-Life Analogy                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SRP       | One class = One job              | Chef cooks, Driver drives                  |
| OCP       | Add without changing old code    | Add games to console without updates       |
| LSP       | Subclass fits like a glove       | Duck must act like Animal if it inherits it|
| ISP       | Small interfaces, no extras      | Remote for TV shouldn't control AC         |
| DIP       | Depend on abstraction            | Switch doesn‚Äôt care what device it powers  |

## üôå Final Thoughts

Following **SOLID** makes your code:

‚úÖ Easy to maintain  
‚úÖ Easy to scale  
‚úÖ Easy to test  
‚úÖ Flexible and reusable
