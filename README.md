# ðŸŒŸ SOLID Principles in C++ (Beginner-Friendly) ðŸš€

Welcome to the easiest and cleanest explanation of the **SOLID principles** using **C++**!  
These 5 principles help you write clean, maintainable, and bug-free code using object-oriented design.

---

## ðŸ“š What is SOLID?

> **SOLID** is an acronym for 5 design principles in OOP:

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open/Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle


---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have only **one job** or **one reason to change**.

ðŸ“Œ Keep each class focused on one task only.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> A class should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

ðŸ“Œ You should be able to **add new features** without changing old code.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Subclasses should be **replaceable** with their base class without breaking the code.

ðŸ“Œ Objects of a subclass should behave like the parent class.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Don't force a class to implement **methods it doesn't use**.

ðŸ“Œ Create small, specific interfaces instead of one big interface.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should depend on **abstractions**, not on concrete classes.

ðŸ“Œ Use interfaces so your code is flexible and loosely coupled.

## ðŸ™Œ Summary

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| SRP | One class = One job |
| OCP | Extend code without changing it |
| LSP | Subclass can replace parent class |
| ISP | No unnecessary methods in interfaces |
| DIP | Depend on interfaces, not concrete classes |
